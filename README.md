# ML-powered-Mechanical-Stress-prediction-of-Bio-Inspired-Surfaces

This repository gives a gist of the data generation, type of data handled, models used to predict the stress distribution of a bi-material pillar. The final data and model are excluded from this repository as it is classified. The idea and inspiration are explained in the project outline powerpoint file.
